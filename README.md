## There is a scene file in Sample Scene folder. Simply run it inside unity to run the prototype game.

**Game Design:** the prototype is built with incremental advancements in operating
a resource miner. The player will start with a simple setup and will have to
advance to a complex operation by clicking and choosing to upgrade their
progression.

**Game features:** Finite State Machine to govern the AI and let all the characters
perform actions continuously in an ‘idling’ manner.
